Laplace-Filter:
      This filter is to sharpen or blur the image. The algorithm is
      based on the mechanism of diffusion in fluids. Each color
      value of a pixel is interpreted as a concentration of
      material. The partial differential equation describing the
      diffusion process is given by 
  
                       du/dt = D * (laplace u)
  
      The value of D is responsible for either blurring or
      sharpening the image. For positive values it sharpens and for
      negative it blurs the image.
