Gaussian Blur:
      This method uses the Gaussian function to calculate the
      mask. The standard deviation (sigma) and the size of the mask
      are parameters to be changed by user. With small sigma and
      mask size, this filter tends to blur the image slightly. To
      blur the image heavily, a larger sigma and mask size should be
      applied. The following gaussian function is used to calculate
      mask: 
               G = exp(-a^2/(2*sigma^2)) / (sigma*sqrt(2*pi))
  
      then, the mask M of size nxn is given as:
  
          M(x,y) = G(x-(n+1)/2,sigma)*G(y-(n+1)/2,sigma)
  
      where:  1<=x<=n and 1<=y<=n. 
  
      Finally the original image matrix is convolved with this mask,
      to get the filtered image.
