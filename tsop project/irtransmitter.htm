<h1>Simple IR transmitter circuit</h1>
<p>
</p><h2>Transmitter circuit information</h2>
<p>
This is an IR transmitting circuit which can be used
in many projects (I designed this to try to make my 3D glasses
wireless). This IR transmitter sends 40 kHz (frequency can be
adjusted using R2) carrier under computer control (computer can
turn the IR transmission on and off). IR carriers at
around 40 kHz carrier frequency are widely used in TV remote
controlling and ICs for receiving these signals are quite
easily available.
</p><p>
The circuit can be controlled using any TTL or RS-232C
level control signal which makes the interfacing very simple.
The circuit can be used for example for using computer to generate
IR remote control signals or experimental IR data transmission.

</p><p>
</p><p>
The circuit works so that when the input (LEFT/RIGHT CONTROL) pin
is in logic high state (+4..15V) the transmitter is on and when
it is in logic low state (+1V..-15V) the transmitter is off.

</p><h3>IR receiver and sega glass interface circuit</h3>
<p>
I designed the circuit to make my Sega 3D glasses wireless, but
system did not work as well as I wanted it to work. I used the
circuit below to receiving the IR signals and controlling the
IR glasses.

</p><h4>Component list</h4>
<pre>Amount  Component
  2     10 kohm resistor
  2     22 kohm resistor
  1     10 uF electrolytic capacitor
  1     100 nF capacitor
  1     10 nF capacitor
  1     78L05 regulator (normal 7805 works also)
  1     GP1U52X receiver module
  3     1N4148 diode
  1     2N2222 transistor (BC547 works also)
  1     3.5 mm stereo jack
</pre>
<h3>Modification ideas</h3>
<p>
The circuit can be also used for slow serial data transfer by connecting
RS-232 data output to the transmitter module left/right control pin and
connect the output of GP1U52X receiver module to RS-232 data input through
suitable RS-232 buffer circuit. Maximum data rates achievable are
at around 1200-2400 bps speed.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support.tandy.com/support_supplies/17533.htm">GP1U52X</a> is quite hard component to get outside USA (in USA Radio Shack sells it cat. No. 276-0137). European experiments
can try to replace it with SFH 506 or SFH 507
from <a href="http://www.siemens.de/">Siemens</a>.
According some comments I have got none of the components I mentioned
(GP1U52H, SFH506, SFH507) are no longer available, so you might not be able
to get those. I don't know what would be a good more modern component
replacement, because I have not tried other types than those myself.
